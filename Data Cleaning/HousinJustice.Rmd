# What are the income distributions in each census tract?

 
 What's considered low-income is dependent on the cost of living of that location, thus, we used the [HUD's](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2022/2022summary.odn) measure of Low-Income in Chartlottesville and Richmond as our threshold as well. Below is the Median Family Income for these cities and the definitions used by the HUD.
 
* Low-Income: "The calculation normally used, therefore, is to set the 4-person low-income limit at 1.6 (i.e. 80%/50%) times the relevant 4-person very low income limit"  
* Very Low-Income: "The 4-person Very Low-Income Limit (VLIL) is based on 50% of the median family income estimated for the Charlottesville, VA MSA."
* Extremely Low-Income: "The FY 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act changed the definition of extremely low-income to be the greater of 30/50ths (60 percent) of the Section 8 very low-income limit or the poverty guideline as established by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provided that this amount is not greater than the Section 8 50% very low-income limit."

The numbers on the site are after they've done their adjustments. We also looked at the [national poverty thresholds set by the Census Bureau] (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html). Both websites have poverty levels depending on the family size. The Census Bureau also accounted for the number of children, whereas the HUD sets these thresholds based on the houshold occupancy. Therefore, we looked at the [Average Household Size Data Table](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=B25010) and calculated the Average in the counties we were looking at (Richmond: 2.5 and Chartlottesville: 2.34). We used the thresdolds for a family of 2.5 people (with no children). According to the Census Bureau, the weight average poverty thresholds for a family of 2.5 people is $18,662, which is way below the extremely low-income limits in Charlottesville and Richmond. 

(also include how you had to work iwht the categories already set by the cenus bureau, also note that the median for Charlottesville MSA excludes Louisa county)
